            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU willed me to write unto you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hundred pound which you were pleased to promise present paiment of, if your Treasury were not empty:</p>
                  <p>But since I saw you last, the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so terribly unto me, that (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>torn the caul of my heart</hi>) he discovered the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and covetousnesse that lay hid,
<note place="margin">Hos. 13.8.</note> and close co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in my flesh.</p>
                  <p>That which brought it forth (next to the eternal spirit and everlasting burnings within me) was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of Tithes, which I took at first from your hands as a maintenance allowed me by the Lord, in you and the rest of the honourable Commissioners, who in much love appointed this as a portion for my poor Family, and as a reward for my former services and sufferings for the State, and the Saints in <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which undeserved favour (as I thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) so did I quietly possesse the same in silence and quietness of mind, till the Lord God Almighty began to <hi>roar like a man of War,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 42.13, 14</note>
                     <hi>and to cry like a woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> within me, bringing forth himself in that I shall now declare unto you, and to the Churches in <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you Sir in private, that in my late publique
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118224:4"/>Teachings I was carried forth contrary to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my own Spirit, willing rather to sit still in silence, and spiritual retirements with my God, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his glorious appearance with power in all his people.</p>
                  <p>But so it was, that by a speciall providence I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to the people, whom I acquainted that to my present apprehension, I was not certain that I had any call from God or man, or from my self, but meerly by a strong hand, I know not how, I was thrust forth into the Harvest, where I was immediatly met with the noyse of Tythes in this manner:</p>
                  <p>The first Scripture I opened, not to preach, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expound, (according to the Teaching of God in mee) was <hi>Isaiah</hi> 61.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>There I saw and said, that God in Christ had glad tidings to speak, and great things to doe (in these last dayes also) for three sorts of people; for the poor, for the oppressed, and for the Prisoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The meek</hi> thats the <hi>poor,</hi> as Christ interprets <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>the broken hearted,</hi> thats the <hi>oppressed,</hi> as every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can testifie, and the <hi>opening of the prison doors to them that are bound, is good tydings for the Prisoner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This day</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares;</hi> and this have we heard and seen in our dayes, God so appearing in the present powers, that 'twas hoped this was <hi>the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> for the people of the Land to look for their long expected and promised liberty to the Captives, who, by an Act of Justice and Mercy from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> are set free from their severall Prisons, (yea, from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain captivity in part) as the first fruits of that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Redemption which the oppressed, and the Poor of the Nation doe likewise hope for.</p>
                  <p>But before I heard of that News, I had formed my matter in this Method;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>March</hi> 7.</note> the first moneth of the year I began to speak for the poor from these Scriptures
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118224:4"/>on severall Sundayes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1, 2. and 14.32. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.4.</p>
                  <p>With this last I began the second moneth for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.4.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aprill</hi> 4. <hi>May</hi> 2. to 30</note> as afterward I ended the third moneth with the Prisoner, from <hi>Isai.</hi> 42.6, 7, and 49, 8, 9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11, 12. but before that I spake for the oppressed, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. <hi>v.</hi> 1.4. that when <hi>the King and his Son should come to raign, he would break in pieces the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor,</hi> oppression must cease, and the oppressed must have ease.</p>
                  <p>The next first day of the week, I spake from <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. That <hi>the bloud</hi> of poor <hi>oppressed men is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eyes of God,</hi> for he <hi>eyes them</hi> and all their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors as another Prophet phraseth it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9.</p>
                  <p>Upon this God began (as I said before) to roar in my Spirit, and I to hear nothing within me but the cry of the oppressed, 'twas far (me thought) from my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to tread on a worm, or to oppresse the poorest creature in the world, but still 'twas told me both wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and sleeping that God would <hi>break in pieces the oppressor,</hi> and that the <hi>bloud</hi> of the poor was <hi>precious in his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the oppression of Tithes came to my eares, and the cry of the oppressed filled my heart, telling me, That I and my children fed on their flesh, that we drunk their bloud, and lived softly on their hard labour and sweat.</p>
                  <p>All the Petitions against Tithes were presently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and spread before me by God, who asked, Is it not the gain of oppression that thou and thine live on?</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, there was never a day went over my head, but I heard something of him from God, and from men also, who, not knowing the working and wrath that was within, did continually hit me in the teeth with something of Tithes.</p>
                  <p>One came to my Chamber, a worthy Gentleman from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118224:5"/>
                     <hi>England,</hi> complaining of the Commissioners of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>-shire, who (as he came along) had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Christchurch, to take a more strict account of each mans Tithes, and that he met with many poor country men in the way crying out of their oppression, and that (as they said) by the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Another day an honest man of our Country, comes in and tells me, he had formerly taken a good bargain of Tithes from the Commissioners or <hi>Glamorgan</hi>-shire, but he had no rest in his spirit from the time he farmed it from them, but was continually tormented till he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it up, which he did (as he said) very quickly, else he thought in his heart he had run starke mad out of his wits.</p>
                  <p>And truly Sir 'twas so with me in this, though I have been <hi>afflicted from my youth, and suffered the terrors of the Lord to distraction,</hi> yet (for the time) I was never so distracted, confounded, and filled with feares in all my former temptations, as in this of Tithes.</p>
                  <p>And yet this trouble was not like those legall terrors I suffered of old, but it was like fire in my bones, which I beleeve is the eternall Spirit, and everlasting burnings, which will shortly break forth upon all the oppressors of the land, to burn up their flesh, fulnesse, and those fair buildings which they have raised on the ruines of others, enriching themselves in the Nations poverty.</p>
                  <p>The fire that was within me had new fuell cast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to my feeling increased to feircer flames, for every day I opened my Bible to read (the remembrance of Tithes coming still to my mind) the first line that darted in mine eyes, was alwayes something against Oppression, as <hi>Isay</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Micah</hi> 2.2, 3, 8, 9, 10. <hi>ver.</hi> Again, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 9.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 30.10, 11, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. These and many other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures came not in by way of a Concordance, nor yet as sought out by me, but they found me out, so that I once feared to open the book any more.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118224:5"/>
                  <p> But there <hi>was a book within me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 29.18.</note> which though I would shut, and be willingly deaf to what was written therein, yet I was made to hear with a witnesse, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 33.14. <hi>The sinners of</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid, fearfulnesse hath surprized the hypocrites, who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with the everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? he that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly, and despiseth the gain of Oppression, &amp;c. he shall dwell on high, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was my morning thought,

                        <hi>April,</hi> 8.</note> which made me rise up quick from my bed, and after second thoughts I hastened away to Church, where the Sheriffe and Judges were expected to come unto sermon, there I resolved in the face of all the Country to cast off the gain of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and burthen of Tithes, intending (with their Honours leave) in the end of all, to have spoken a few words on <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.5. But the Judges not coming that day to Church, the Preacher did no more but expound in the pue (there being but a thin Audience) upon this my former resolutions fell, and I thought within my self, surely the Lord would not I should openly meddle with this point, nor be too scrupulous in an outward thing, as this of Tithes, so I quietly heard the Man, and God also, in the very words then read, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Surely Oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all this I returned home without the least touch, or trouble of conscience, saying, now I shall have peace and be still, provided for as formerly, I have been to <hi>offer up my Isaack,</hi> my beloved Tithes, but the Lord hath spared it and accepted me; I see <hi>a Ram caught in the bush for a Sacrifice,</hi> that is, my carnall mind and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for now I looked upon this of Tithes but as a fleshly outward thing, a poor low business for any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man to be scrupulous of, therefore I said, I would go to my <hi>heights</hi> again, if once I might <hi>see the King in his beauty, and the land that is very farre off,</hi> Isaiah 33.16.17.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118224:6"/>
                  <p> The next day I came to your chamber, where I was welcomed with respect and kindnesse, but before I could sleep that night I was awaked again, and the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>answer in the secret place of Thunder,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Psal 81.7.</note> he that <hi>despiseth not the gain of Oppression shall not dwell on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then down I came to the deep, and dwelt that night in the dark, in the shadow of death, yea, in the belly of hell, I cryed the next day also, <hi>O Lord I am oppressed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for me, Isai.</hi> 38.14.</p>
                  <p>This Scripture was that dayes Text; when I was to speak good things to the oppressed, I heard nothing but bad newes and sad tidings to my self, standing there under the <hi>gain of Oppression,</hi> I could experimentally tell this truth, that God would plague the oppressor, in whose stead (me thought) I was that day <hi>chattering like a Crane, and mourning as a Dove,</hi> in my cry, <hi>O Lord I am oppressed, undertake for me,</hi> it was answered, thou art an <hi>oppressor of men,</hi> and now thou art justly oppressed by God.</p>
                  <p>That was the summe of that morning exercise, how men oppresse God in mans oppression, and then that God oppresseth also their spirits as they doe his.</p>
                  <p>Truly to that time I never found the experience of this so true, <hi>The love of money is the root of all evill,</hi> evill of sin and of punishment, for by this I began, not onely <hi>to erre from the faith,</hi> and from trusting on God, but <hi>to be pierced through with many sorrowes, yea, to be drowned in perdition and destruction,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>And yet how often did my desire to be rich make me fear to be poor, and my proud heart seek to silence the cries of God and men within me, to shift off the thoughts of oppression, and the businesse of Tithes, as a thing not belonging to me, but for the States to reform? Again, my heart told me, that Tithes are now new modled and set in another form, with some moderation also.</p>
                  <p>And again, Tithes are coming into the Treasury of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118224:6"/>the Common-wealth, God forbid said one within me, but thought I, why may not I take at present this free gift from the civill powers, as the Pastors, Teachers, and Preachers of the Gospel in <hi>Wales</hi> this day, who are maintained by Tithes.</p>
                  <p>Oh this renewed my former troubles, enraged those terrors, telling me, if now I be silent, I should not onely betray my Country, and the Governours of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to the judgement of God, but be base, and lye to the Churches, not speaking the truth, which many poor Christians, not attending to, doe daily wound their weak consciences by a little too much worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (as in other things) so in farming of Tithes, which all the godly Preachers and people of God in <hi>Wales,</hi> did formerly profess, preach, and pray against.</p>
                  <p>Thus many Ministers also are unsensibly fallen into a new light, which themselves condemned in others, for my part I follow the old, and professe, that I can see yet nothing in Tithes but the <hi>gain of Oppression,</hi> continued and kept up meerly by Ministers, and Church-Members, who being men of power this day, might easily prevaile to remove this and many other oppressions, at least, with the people of the Land to petition the present Governours, to ease the oppressed of their burthens, as to release the prisoners from their bonds, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive poor families with bread by a publick stock.</p>
                  <p>I speak not now of those Tithes which are part of mens temporal estates, but of such Ecclesiastick revenues appointed at first for Popish Priests, now for Preachers of the Gospel, this being a greater oppression than the tithes of former times, my spirit was oppressed by the Lord, till I had quite thrown away this abhomination, and burthen of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Thus then to me it is presented as more oppressive than Priestly Tithes; secondly, more oppressive than Popish Tithes; and thirdly, than Prelatick, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Tithes heretofore.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:118224:7"/>
                  <p> First I say, Priestly Tithes under the Law had the command of God. Secondly, 'twas not forced on men by the power of the sword, but either freely given by the people, or urged by the Prophets with promises and threats to such who were disobedient or unwilling: Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Deut. 14.28, 29.</note> the Priests did not eat up all the Tithes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but as there was a yearly Tithe for the Priest, so every third year, there was a tithe for the poor; Oh, that the poor might have their Arrears out of the unreasonable gain of Gospel-Priests. Fourthly, Priests under the Law had but the tenth, our Preachers of the Gospel take up the fifth or fourth of mens lands and labours. Fiftly, the Priests who had Tithes paid them, had no other portion or temporal estate as most of our Ministers have, who may therefore preach the Gospel freely, if they can.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are more oppressive than <hi>Popish Tithes</hi> in forrain parts, <hi>France,</hi> the Kingdome of Asses (as 'tis called) hath not such an oppression in Tithes for their Priests, as our Protestant Teachers and Preachers of the Gospel doe burthen this free Nation; for as 'tis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported by some, who have long liv'd in <hi>France,</hi> that there and in <hi>Spain</hi> also, onely Tithe of hard corn is paid, that is, of Wheat and Rye, but no Tithe of Barley, Oates, Pease, Beans, Fitches, Tills, much lesse Tithe of Hops, Hemp, Flaxe, Saffron, or of garden Hearbs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly 'tis not the tenth sheaf as ours, but onely the twentieth sheaf of Wheat and Rie is paid with them. Thirdly, if there be but nineteen Lambs, there is none, if thirty nine there is but one Lamb for the Priest, as one of twentie, and two of fortie is his Tithe, but our Gospel-Priests must have one Lamb of ten, yea, one of seven if there be no more. Fourthly ours have not onely the tenth Lamb, but tithe of the Wool of the nine remaining, wherers the Popish Priest hath no tithe of wool at all. Fifthly, They take no Tithe of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118224:7"/>calves, hay, hay-grasse, or justments, much less tithe of pigs, geese, apples, eggs, and of every thing almost the poor live on, our Gospel Ministers must have their tithes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly since the Independent Pastors are turnd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Preachers of the Gospel, Parish Priests, the burthen of Tithes hath been more oppressive in them, than in the Prelates and Presbyters heretofore. For first, These were Nationall Ministers, and did service to every Parish in the Nation, therefore the National maintenance was more of right proper for them, but the Independent Churches, separating from the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and professing a Gospel-practice, cannot for shame deny their own Principles, as to keep up Tithes, but rather to look for a maintenance from their own Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or to live of the Gospel, if they preach to the World, I say of the Gospel, that is, to live by faith in God, who will doubtlesse feed his servants, and cause men freely to contribute unto them who preach the Gospel freely. Secondly, The Tithes formerly were never so farmed out to Commissioners friends, who rackt the poor Parishioners to raise their own private gain, though they get forty or fiftie shillings yearly by the bargain. Thirdly, as 'tis more reasonable for the Parish to farm their own Tithes with the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements, so in these times of publike Taxes, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, and necessary burthens on the Nation, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Tithes is more intollerable, but our Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent friends load the people, who hoped to have been eased of all by their meanes. Fourthly, Godly men in <hi>Wales,</hi> who have suffred much for the State, and in tenderness of conscience could not pay Tithes to the Prelates of old, yea, who were indulged in those dayes, are now forced not onely to that, but to pay all their Arrears of Tithes formerly spared. Fifthly, as Tithes under this oppressive Form was first established by the Churches of <hi>Wales,</hi> who have given example for the English to follow the pattern and oppression; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118224:8"/>what the Churches there have gained by this, even more Officers in the Church than ever Christ comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as Commissioners, Treasurers, Sequestrators and Collectors for Tithes, a thing which neither Law nor Gospel, nor former Ages ever heard of. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Hos. 6.8, 9.</note> God compareth such unto <hi>Thieves and Robbers: Gilead is a Citie of them that work iniquitie, and polluted with bloud,</hi> or as the Margen reads, <hi>cunning for bloud: And as Troops of Robbers wait for a man, so the companie of Priests murther in the way by consent;</hi> the <hi>Geneva</hi> notes <hi>Gilead</hi> to be the Citie where the Priests dwelt, and the <hi>companie of them</hi> was like a Synod or Classis. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents and Presbyters agree together and consent in <hi>Tithes.</hi> Seventhly, Doe not the Churches by this rob God also, (this at least being a Typical expression of their spiritual robberie) <hi>Will a man rob God? yet yee have robbed me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 2.10, 14, 17. Mal. 3.7, 8, 13.</note>
                     <hi>saith the Lord: But ye said, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings,</hi> Mal. 3.8. Pray observe in this and in the former Chapters how oft God seeks to convince the Priests six times together, but the Priests will by no meanes be convinced by God himself of their manifest hypocrisie. Secondly, That God speaks to the Priests in both Chapters is plain from <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And now, O ye Priests, this word is for you,</hi> and 'tis their word also, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>What profit is it that we have kept thy Ordinances, and walked mournfully,</hi> Or as the Hebrew reads it, <hi>walked in black,</hi> that is their garbe, as <hi>Baals Priests</hi> are called <hi>Chemarim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.4.</note> or Black coats: Now, <hi>What profit is it</hi> (say they) <hi>that we have kept thine Ordinance?</hi> It is not Ordinances, but thine Ordinance, the Lords Ordinance (as I shall shew another time) is the Spirits presence and power from on high, this was the first Gospel-Ordinance, the Baptism of the Spirit and of Fire, for the appearance of the Spirit was on every Ordinance of the Gospel,
<note place="margin">Acts 1.4, 5. Acts 2.38. Acts 8.6, 28.</note> in water-Baptism, there was the promise of the gift of the Spirit, and the power of the Spirit in some visible gifts appeared with every one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118224:8"/>that did baptize in breaking of bread,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13. 1 Cor. 14, 15. 2 Pet. 1.12.</note> they dranke into one Spirit, they did sing in the Spirit, pray in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, preach the Gospel with the holy Spirit sent down from heaven; yea, in truth, all outward Ordinances of the Gospel were but the Ordinances of man, though appointed by God, the appearance and power of the Spirit was the Ordinance of God, but <hi>what profit</hi> (say the Priests) <hi>is it that we have kept thine Ordinances,</hi> waited on the Spirit, there's no profit in this.</p>
                  <p>Truly, the Spirits presence was more waited on, and the Saints in <hi>Wales</hi> were far more spiritual before their Church-fellowship, more simple-hearted, sincere, self-denying, and dying to the world, yea, though they walkt in Ordinances, there was no talk then of Ordinances, they were dead unto them (it being the worlds Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) the Saints were all drawn up to the Spirit, which made them to be scoft of the world, which now they follow in their principles, practice, and desire of profit? <hi>What profit say they?</hi> Oh, there is no profit in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits presence in the Ordinance of God; the power of men, the Ordinance for Tithes, and maintenance for Ministers hath more profit with it.</p>
                  <p>Well Friends, you must shortly walk in black, and mournfully with your Forefathers, the Prelates and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, because you follow their steps in the height of your Spirits, and lowness of your walkings, in your worldly designs, in your desires for profit, your tithes, augmentations, consolidations, Church offerings and such things, unheard of in Gospel-times, yea, it was a strange language to latter dayes.</p>
                  <p>But how doe the Priests <hi>rob God in tithes and offerings?</hi> the people rather should be said to rob the Priests in this, and yet it is proved before that all was spoken of the Priests, <hi>they rob God in Tithes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly there's a Mystery in this (as in all other legall expressions (<hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Isai.</hi> 66.23.) For as Gods <hi>Tith or tenth</hi> is that small remnant of his people
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118224:9"/>reserved from the Churches Apostasie, <hi>Isai.</hi> 6.13. <hi>In it shall be the tenth,</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Lords offerings</hi> is all the <hi>people of the land: Bring yee all the Tithes into my storehouse that there may be meat in mine house, Mal.</hi> 3.10. The Lords House is of a larger building then the gathered Churches have set up, as you may see <hi>Isaiah</hi> 66.19, 20. Where many Nations, yea, strange and savage people are brought into the house of God, who (I beleive) in his due time will gather these three Nations into one Church, (as the first fruits of his glory and fame to the world)</p>
                  <p>So then the <hi>whole Nation</hi> is the <hi>Lords offering,</hi> a Nation to be offred unto God. God is now rob'd of this offering by our Gospel-Priests, not onely the Tithes, the scattered Saints, but the Nation, even the Lords offering God is robbed of by the gathered Churches and their Priests.</p>
                  <p>For so it is clearer exprest by <hi>Malachy,</hi> c. 3. v. 9. <hi>Ye are cursed with a curse, for yee have robbed me, even this whole Nation,</hi> not that the whole Nation did rob God, as the words seem to import, but taking away the word [even] not in the Hebrew, the sence is clear, <hi>ye have robbed me this whole Nation;</hi> that is, as <hi>[God with us]</hi> is the Nations Motto, so God in the Nation, or the whole Nation, as the offering or people of God, the Independent Churches will not own, though the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in this are of a better judgement, who professe the Nation to be in Covenant with God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and upon this account baptize all their children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But sure 'tis a truth not onely in the Mysterie, but in the Historie or Letter, The Priests in Tithes and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings doe <hi>rob the whole Nation,</hi> for the Nation is even ruined by the oppression thereof, Therefore our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Priests, who by the power of the sword take up their Tithes, or other wayes force a maintenance from the people, are called thieves and robbers by God.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:118224:9"/>
                  <p> Oh how secretly and suddenly is the day of the Lord, or the Lords day stollen upon the Churches of <hi>Wales,</hi> Christ being come as a Theif in the night to spoil them of all their glory and honour, yea, their goodness is quite gone, and carried away into captivity.</p>
                  <p>For how hath <hi>God prophaned the Princes of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> or <hi>the holy Princes,</hi> as the Hebrew reads.
<note place="margin">Isai. 43.28.</note> The <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes</hi> in Church and Commonwealth are not onely become <hi>prophane,</hi> covetous, cruel, cunning for bloud, but they are prophaned by God, this the <hi>holy Princes</hi> will not hear that God should prophane any man, but now they may learn by experience, and be made to cry at last; <hi>Lord, why hast thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardned our hearts from thy fear,?</hi> Isai. 63.17.</p>
                  <p>Oh what prophanesse is this, that the holy Princes should be not onely proud, peevish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thieves and robbers in the way, to rob the whole Nation,
<note place="margin">Isai. 43.28.</note> to rob God and man at once?</p>
                  <p>No wonder, <hi>God doth give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches:</hi> This is worse then hanging it self to have the curse of God, and the contempt of man; truly it is far from my temper to reproach any man, much lesse the people of God, but if God shall give them to the reproach and the curse, what man can help it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will send a curse upon you, and curse your blessings, yea, I have cursed them already, because ye have not laid it to heart,</hi> Mal. 2.2. <hi>Behold I will corrupt your seed,</hi> (or as the Margent reads, <hi>I will reprove your seed,</hi> and not onely the Word you preach, but the tithe-corn you gather for pay, and the tithe of your cattle too, <hi>I will spread their dung on your faces, and the dung of your solemn feasts, and thanksgiving dayes,</hi> when ye look up to bless my Name, <hi>I will spread dung on your faces,</hi> v. 3.</p>
                  <p>And then it followes <hi>one shall take you away with it, v.</hi> 3. One, Who is that? Sure there needs not the strength of many, but <hi>one</hi> man, yea, a babe in Christ can take away the Church with the Priest from their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118224:10"/>places. How easie is it for <hi>one,</hi> for a very child, with his little finger to push down all the Churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> being fallen already by their own divisions and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in worship, and in their walkings also, their wrath, worldliness, and which is worse, the thing of Tithes, wherewith they have foul'd their fingers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yee are departed out of the way, yee have caused many to stumble at the Law, (or in the Law) yee have corrupted the covenant of</hi> Levi, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Whats the Covenant of <hi>Levi?</hi> Oh to live in the Lord alone, to look for maintenance from him onely, no other maintenance but himself, for he was <hi>Levies</hi> portion.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was with <hi>Levi,</hi> and the Priests of old under the Law, the other Tribes had portions in the land, but the Lord God alone was <hi>Levies</hi> portion, and yet his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance was from all, so <hi>Levi</hi> wanted nothing, though he had no portion but the Lord. Thus 'twas with the Apostles and Primitive preachers of the Gospel,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.35.</note> they went forth <hi>without scrip or silver in their purses,</hi> yet they <hi>wanted nothing,</hi> and having <hi>nothing, they possessed all things,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10.</p>
                  <p>But our Gospel-Priests must have portions in the Land,
<note place="margin">Mal. 2.9.</note> or pay in their hand, else they will not preach: Therefore saith God, <hi>I have made you contemptible and base before all the people.</hi> Truly Sir, as I was forcibly carried forth to speak at first, so now to write my last, which I pray receive as the words of a dying man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to dye to all things below God to my own life and livelihood.</p>
                  <p>Others preach for a hundred pound a year, I have now preached to lose it, in which indeed I have found my life, and a better livelihood in the Lord, who hath promised that he will not <hi>leave me, nor forsake me,</hi> Hebr. 13. And truly you may beleeve me, have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, quietnesse, comfort in my present losse, and low estate,
<note place="margin">Mich. 5.7.</note> then in all my gainfull Tithes.</p>
                  <p>I then laboured to be rich, I now learn to bee poor,

                     <hi>not to wait on men, nor the sounes of men,</hi> but on the mercifull providence and dispose of God for my abode and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus saith the Lord God,
<note place="margin">Jer. 49.11.</note>
                     <hi>Leave thy fatherlesse children, and I will preserve them alive, and let thy widdows trust in me,</hi> my children are now fatherlesse, and my wife a widdow, but God will be a father to them and a husband to her, yea, her Physitian also according to promise, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.6, 7, 8. But all men are my flesh also, and because I would not <hi>hide my self</hi> from them,
<note place="margin">Isal. 58.7.</note> I had it once in my thoughts to take this hundred pound at present, and to give it as a publike stock for the poor of <hi>Cardiffe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was presently answered unto me,

                     <hi>I hate robbery for burnt offerings,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>or the holy Princes,</hi> as I said before; there are principall men among the people of God, for whom the Prophet must cry and howle, because <hi>the Sword is drawn forth both against the righteous and the wicked,</hi> Ezek. 21.3. And <hi>against all the Princes of Israel,</hi> verse 12. Yea, the Sword is doubled the third time, the <hi>Sword of the great men, which enters into their privy Chambers,</hi> (or closest Councels) <hi>and the point of the Sword is set against their gates,</hi> (or Governments) that <hi>their hearts may faint, and their ruines be multiplied, ah it is made bright, and wrapt for slaughter,</hi> verse 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>But among <hi>all the holy Princes</hi> there is one especially whom the Lord calls upon, <hi>Thou prophane wicked Prince, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,</hi> verse 25. <hi>Remove the Diadem, take off the Crown, this shall not be the same, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As King and Lords had an end, and twice the Sword hath been against the <hi>Prelatick</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party, so the Sword being doubled, <hi>the third time will smite that prophane and wicked Prince,</hi> whatever he be, who is the Oppressor, who is <hi>imperious, proud, peevish, covetous, cruell and cunning</hi> for bloud; oh the Sword of the Lord will find him out, for 'tis <hi>wrape for slaughter,</hi> 'tis wrapt, I say, and <hi>secretly 'twill come forth,</hi> to cut off the man that stands before God, to oppose <hi>the appearance of God in men,</hi> to oppresse the spirits of men, and the Spirit of God in them, <hi>the Sword of his mouth shall slay him,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                  <p>I shall not now meddle with matters of State, nor of secular men (though these also may come under the

                  <p>
                     <hi>The golden City</hi> is the most glorious Church state, or the people of God in highest honour and glory; this <hi>is the golden City,</hi> or (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> reads) the <hi>Gold thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting City, the exactresse of Gold,</hi> as the margin notes.</p>
                  <p>None doe more exact, and more thirst after Silver and Gold this day, then <hi>the people of God in spirituall power,</hi> and therefore no wonder they doe so oppresse both the states of men, and the spirits of men, yea, the Spirit of God, as may be seen at large, <hi>Micah</hi> 2.2, 6, 7. compared with 8, 9, 10. verses, <hi>Even of late my people is risen up as an Enemy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh the great Oppressor! how the earth doth rejoyce at the ruine of that man, <hi>who smote the peogle in wrath</hi> with a <hi>continuall stroke, that ruled the Nations in anger,</hi> (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of love, mercy, and goodnesse to mankind, or the poor, appeared in him) <hi>but he persecuteth and no man hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 14.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>whole Earth is merry at his fall,</hi> so <hi>hell from beneath is moved for him, to meet him at his coming it stirs up the dead, and even all the cheif ones of the earth, and all the Kings of the Nations rise up from their Thrones, they say, art thou also weak as we? art thou become like unto us?</hi> verse 4.10.</p>
                  <p>What are the <hi>people of God,</hi> and <hi>Princes of Israel the holy Princes, so prophane?</hi> Is the <hi>prophane Prince of Israel so weak?</hi> weak as the imperious whorish woman? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.30. Art thou so weak as we? weak in thy passions and pettish Spirit? art thou become like unto us, as one of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or the Princes of <hi>Wales?</hi> What man would think, that the Church or People of God should ever come to this, to oppresse both God and man, good and bad at once? But this is naturall to spirituall men in Church formes, yea, to the flesh of the best
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118224:14"/>Christians,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.3. Gal. 4.29.</note> who may for a time be very fleshly, and yet the children of God, as <hi>Ishmael was Abrahams sonne after the flesh, persecuting him that was born after the Spirit;</hi> yea, Saints by calling may be called carnall, much more <hi>when they are become so wise after the flesh, so mighty, and so noble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note> which must have an Almighty power of the Spirit, to make them foolish, and weak, and base, and nothing, to bring to nought things that are; the great things and Conquests here attained by the people of God was when they were nothing, now being something they are overcome by all, and by themselves.</p>
                  <p>When men doe adore the people of God, and idolize them as <hi>the Gods of the earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.11.</note> then a thousand to one, <hi>God does befoole and famish them,</hi> and they fail to be proud, and to oppress the world, yea, their own Brethren, and their Father also, even the most high God, appearing in lowest Saints above them in grace, and the knowledge of our Lord, in simplicity, in purenesse, and peace, and in patience also.</p>
                  <p>Well this is the thing that God will <hi>doe with his own,</hi> he will <hi>undoe them,</hi> either by the high discoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in them, as the Prophet was, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 6.1. who came to this, that he saw himself, though as good as the best, yet as bad as the worst, <hi>verse</hi> 3, 5. Or else he will undoe them, by discovering that without to the world which is within in the heart,
<note place="margin">1 King. 8.38. Iam. 3.6.</note> what <hi>a plague is</hi> in it? <hi>what a sinke and sea of sin?</hi> yea, a hell is in the tongue, this the Saints will not see, but God does, and men shall, when he shall turn their inside out, their hidden hypocrisie shall appear to all, for they shall openly <hi>practise hypocrisie,</hi> as men doe grosse prophaneness, for <hi>the vile person shall be no more called liberall, nor the Churle said to be bountifull, &amp;c.</hi> Isaiah 32.5, 6, 7. see it.</p>
                  <p>Alas man, <hi>Thou maist give all that thou hast to the poor yet have no love:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3. Tit. 3.4. 1 Ioh. 4.16.</note> Oh belye not the Spirit of God in thee, for <hi>God is love, and good to all mankind,</hi> while thou art a <hi>murtherer</hi> in hating <hi>thy brother, John</hi> 3.15. yea, in not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118224:14"/>loving him so as to <hi>lay down thy life for him,</hi> verse 16. much more in not laying out thy livelihood, and <hi>this worlds good,</hi> verse 17. not onely for the godly, as they say, but for any man that needs thee, who is both thy brother and <hi>thine own flesh,</hi> Isaiah 58.7.</p>
                  <p>Nay tis not enough that thou art no Oppressor, as I said before, but <hi>to loose the bands of wickednesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 58.6.</note>
                     <hi>to undoe the heavy burthens, to let the Oppressed goe free, and to break every yoak is the duty of love, if there be power in thine hands to doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the people of God are silent, and sit still, seeking onely self, not sensible of the <hi>burthens of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi> of the <hi>Prisoners bands,</hi> nor of <hi>poor families who cry for bread,</hi> how dwelleth the love of God in them, saith <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, want of love, besides worldlinesse, wrath, and that oppressive power in the Churches,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.7. Isai. 19.2. Ier. 51.49.</note> is the cause why they are so divided among themselves, yea, <hi>God divides them</hi> (as he did <hi>prophane them</hi>) <hi>he sets Brother against Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ruler against Ruler, one ruling Elder against another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis Rule and Government the Churches still aime at, therefore they not onely dash one against another, but are like to destroy that civill Government, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours they depend upon, for since the Apostacy, the Churches have ever had a dependance on worldly powers, and undone the powers with themselves, and therefore our present Governours are wise to beware of men.</p>
                  <p>But Men, and Ministers, and Churches, as we see, are divided this day like <hi>Babylon</hi> into three parts, as we shall shew anon, and so their destruction is of themselves; I say, they seek for rule, and this ruines them.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a threefold kind of Government among men <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy;</hi> the first is as of the King, the second is like that of the Parliament, the present Government some compare to the third, though it appears not yet, but Parliament and Army have voted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118224:15"/>the Supream power to be in the people.</p>
                  <p>Well, the Churches must have power and rule also, the Prelatick Church was <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> all were ruled by one, by an Arch-Bishop, the Kingly Power or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative fell by that: The Presbyterian Church is an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> the Elders or chief of these govern as 'twere in a Parliament, and Parliamentary priviledges was like to fall by them, if not fallen already: The Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, or baptized Churches (both is one) are a pure <hi>Democracy,</hi> for not the ruling men, or Ministers, but all the Members, have equall power to order and ordain as they professe, and therefore called Independent, I wish they were so, but if they have a dependance on the Civill or Martiall power, 'twill be worse for both, if both be not wiser than former times.</p>
                  <p>A word to the wise, 'tis my folly to use so many to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men as the Ministers are, especiall Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, being men of parts, power, policy, and of piety al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many; I shall fear none of them, because I love them all, and they me, though wrath at present may appear in both, as it doth among themselves ('twas so once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his own people of old, a perfect hatred, <hi>loathing and abhorring one another.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Well, the Vials are yet full of the wrath of God, when these are poured forth, Love will appear, that is, the Lord himself in us all, who will bring forth light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and love out of our divisions: And as he <hi>in wrath remembers mercy,</hi> so in much love, I pray you, remember</p>

                     <note place="margin">Zach. 2.7.</note> but <hi>Zion is</hi> the <hi>state of all the Saints in the Spirit as they are in God, and God in them:</hi> For as <hi>Zion</hi> was the place where God dwelt; so all the Saints from the beginning of the world have been still waiting for this, for the full discoverie of God in them. <hi>Glorious things were spoken of Zion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 87.3.</note> and the people of God both under the law, and in Gospel-dispensation were still going on <hi>from strength to strength,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This glorious appearing of the great God, rising up in higher discoveries of himself in men, is that which hath been ever most opposed and persecuted; I speak not now of the times under the Law, nor Gospel, nor yet of former appearances, since the Apostasie. But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118224:18"/>to goe no further then our own age, what we have heard and seen: How was the appearance of God in the First Reformers, yea, in our Prelates and Bishops per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted as heresie by the Popish Hierarchie! Next the honest Presbyters or Puritans how were they opposed by the same Prelates, who suffered before? Thirdly, these Presbyterians formerly themselves in a suffering condition, persecuted the appearance of God in those of higher forms and fellowships, as the Independent Churches; and these likewise are ready to oppose and persecute the spirits of the Saints, who in worship and doctrine are of higher discoveries then themselves.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of <hi>God and of Christ</hi> for substance is the same in all the Saints, though their apprehensions dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or are divers rather. And who is ignorant of this, that the appearances of God in one man, hath not been the same as it was formerly in himself? and yet all have been going on from <hi>strength to strength,</hi> at least in their desires and aimes toward Zion.</p>
                  <p>Though I am but a child in underdanding, and in yeares also to some of our Elders, yet here I observed four great steps of Gods glorious appearance in mens preaching.</p>
                  <p>First, how low and legall were their teachings, as they learnt the way of preaching from Mr. <hi>Perkins, Bolton, Byfield, Dod,</hi> and <hi>Dike,</hi> most blessed in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by whom, and such conforming Ministers, more men were converted to God, then ever since in any period of time.</p>
                  <p>Next the Doctrine of free Grace came forth, but with lesse successe or fruit of conversion, by Dr. <hi>Preston, Sibs, Crispe,</hi> yet many before converted were confirmed and comforted by their words.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the letter of Scripture, and the flesh of Christ hath been highly set up by both the famous <hi>Goodwins,</hi> the one, Master <hi>John Goodwin</hi> like <hi>Apollos</hi> being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Scriptures and strength of reason; the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118224:18"/>in spirituall discourses of Christs death, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ascension, and intercession, yet much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh; for he meddles not with the Mystery of Christ in us, of his dying in us (as Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> in part discovers) but all of Christ without us, which though a truth, yet not the whole truth, nor that spirit and truth which Christ spake of;
<note place="margin">John 6.63. 2 Cor. 3.6.18</note> for <hi>as the flesh profiteth nothing, but the quickning spirit that dwelt therein;</hi> so the the Apostles had a <hi>ministery of the spirit</hi> to carry men through the flesh of Christ into the Father, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit dwelling in him and them, and so to draw them up into the same fellowship with himself.</p>
                  <p>Again this good man speakes much of Christ in the flesh, not as <hi>he is in the Father, and we in him, and he in us,</hi> which is the sum of our spiritual knowledge, and all we should know of Christ after his Ascension, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he brings us no further then to the <hi>vail of his flesh,</hi> not <hi>through it into the holy of holiest,</hi> into the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it self, that is, into the Father, for Christ was but our fore-runner, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, though the vail of <hi>his flesh</hi> be <hi>a new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way into the holiest,</hi> yet not that flesh as <hi>living,</hi> but as dead and <hi>crucified, became the living way, Heb.</hi> 10.20. (as with God) I shall shew another time.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that worthy man brings men to the <hi>way,</hi> but not to the <hi>Truth and Life:</hi> Now Christ was all, First, the <hi>way for no man cometh to the Father, but by me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 14.6.</note> now 'tis a vain thing to keep men still in the way, to stand still in the way, and not to goe on by Christ into the Father, <hi>into the holiest,</hi> and thus was Christ <hi>the Truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 14.3.</note> also <hi>taking us into the Father with himself,</hi> for as this was <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life to know the Father to be the onely true God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note>
                     <hi>and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ whom he hath sent:</hi> so Christ was sent, or God even the Father was manifest in his flesh, that <hi>we might see God in us, as he was in him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 17.21, 23, 24.</note>
                     <hi>and our life with him in God:</hi> Lastly, thus <hi>Christ is the life,</hi> and thus he that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118224:19"/>hath the Son hath life, that is, the Son being once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in us, reveals the Father in us also, God in our flesh as in his, and we living with him in God alone, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19, 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>This is the knowledge of Christ in the Spirit, and this is the fourth step which some have attained to, holding forth Christ in the Spirit, as Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sterrie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sprig</hi> and others, these with their fellows are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Zion, yet are they not come into it; for as every Prophet shall one day <hi>be ashamed of his vision;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 13.4.</note> yea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie it self shall fail: So it is manifest these men are of a <hi>dark and deeper speech then can be easily understood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 33.19.</note> therefore it is not Zion, when there shall be such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance of God in men, that all shall see and hear him in them, and as they <hi>shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again</hi> Zion,
<note place="margin">Isai. 52.8.</note> (or bring forth himself cleerly in us, who are now in captivity, or he rather captive in our flesh) so men shall hear God himself in us, for so it is in the Hebrew, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.23. not <hi>we have heard that God is with you,</hi> but (we will go with you for) <hi>we have heard God with you, and in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then man shall be nothing, and God shall be all in all, yet man shall be all in God, and nothing but God shall appear in man. This glorious appearance of the great God in man, the <hi>three Shepherds,</hi> the Pastors and Teachers doe <hi>indeed abhor,</hi> they <hi>hate his appearance,</hi> (as I said) and he <hi>abhors</hi> all their performances.</p>
                  <p>But who are these three Shepherds? the Pastors of Churches: What their cutting off is my former Letter shewed, to suffer the curse of God, and contempt of men: How God cuts them off? it is by unchurching them, and by confounding or dividing them, the Lord doth first unchurch them, burns up the Church with fire, <hi>Zachariah</hi> 11.1. there he calls <hi>Lebanon to open the doors,</hi> that the <hi>fire may come in to burn up the tallest Cedars.</hi> Whats Lebanon but the Temple, for it was built with that: Who are the Cedars? but the tallest
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118224:19"/>Members, the <hi>principall of the flock:</hi> What is the <hi>fire?</hi> but the Spirit of the Lord: as the Lord God calls upon <hi>Lebanon,</hi> so he commands that the <hi>Church doors</hi> may be open <hi>for the fire to enter,</hi> and the spirit to burn up all their chiefest members and Ministers, for so it is <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>The mighty men, or the gallants are spoiled,</hi> yea, there is a <hi>howling of the shepherds for their glory is spoiled,</hi> v. 3. Their Church-fellowship and forms is that they glory in; God spoils them, <hi>and stains the pride of all their glory,</hi> yea, he burns it up; How? By fire; <hi>The baptisme of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of fire</hi> was the first Gospel-Ordinance,
<note place="margin">Acts 1.4, 5.</note> or that which first set up the <hi>Church in a Gospel-order.</hi> Fire will be the last that shall burn up the Churches, who because they would not, as the Primitive Saints did, wait for the Spirit to build them, the Spirit shall come to burn and consume them at last.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God cuts them off, confounds and divides them, he cuts them into three parts as we shall see by and by.</p>
                  <p>Thus then the <hi>three shepherds</hi> are the Pastors of all the Churches or whole Ministery of the Church; for as the Apostate Jewish Church was a Type of the Christian Church now under the Apostacie (the <hi>whoredomes of Isreal,</hi> typifying the <hi>great whore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.30. Rev. 17.2.</note> whose fornications and the wine thereof in their forms of doctrine and false worships) as we shall shew another time: so <hi>Junius</hi> well notes the three Shepherds to signifie the whole teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministery of the Jewish Church,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Junium</hi> in Zach. 11.</note> for the Pharisees Sadduces, and Essenes (saith he) were the onely Pastors or Teachers, who did instruct the people in the Word of God, as Prelates, Presbyters, and Independents are the whole Ministery of the Church of <hi>England</hi> this day.</p>
                  <p>These are divided not onely in Worship, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but in doctrine also, especially in three things 1. In the free grace of God, which some call Antinomianism 2. In the free-will of man, which otherscall Pelagianism. 3. In the death of Christ, or universal Redemption
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118224:20"/>of mankind thereby, which both Presbyters and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants abhorre as Paganisme, though nearest the <hi>Gospel indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not now shew the cause of all those divisions in Doctrine, being engaged onely at present to prove their defilements in the worship of God, and in their walking with men.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is one cause of their former difference and divisions in Doctrine,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> because <hi>the Apostles Doctrine,</hi> being before all Gospel-Ordinances, is out of order in the Churches,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.3. 2. Tim. 1.13.</note> who not content with that <hi>forme of sound words,</hi> and <hi>wholsome Doctrine delivered</hi> by them, doe follow the childish Dictates of Fathers, the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, being a company of Bishops, with such Creeds, Confessions, and Catechismes, formed by them (and reformed Churches) whose conformities and fooleries in formes of worship, though our Churches cannot chuse but see, yet with a blind devotion they follow all their formes of doctrine, not suffering a doubt or the least debate to passe upon their reason and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein.</p>
                  <p>How injudicious this is with ingenuous men let all men judge,
<note place="margin">Iohn 3.12.</note> for if I <hi>tell you of earthly things,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and yee beleeve not, how will yee beleeve if I tell you of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly?</hi> all outward worship is but an <hi>earthly thing:</hi> Now if all Fathers and former Churches have erred in worship, why not, I pray you, may they not erre in Doctrine, in heavenly and hidden things in the high Mystery of God and of Christ? especially seeing the Apostles did prophesie of <hi>such deceit to come in this, by vain</hi> Philosophy,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.8.</note> and metaphysicall speculations of the Deity, <hi>by the traditions and inventions of men, the rudiments of the world,</hi> the rudiments, that is, the A. B. C. or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Catechismes, which is the Religion of the world, and of little Children.</p>
                  <p>Another cause of divisions in Doctrine is this, the confidence of men and Ministers, who conceive, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118224:20"/>Christians know God and Christ already, whereas themselves are ignorant of both,
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.7. os Rev. 5.2.</note> not minding that <hi>God is a Mystery,</hi> and that the Mystery of <hi>Christ hath been a sealed Book</hi> ever since the Apostasie, as I have shewn, in a book of <hi>neither Truth nor Error,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nor Truth, nor Error, &amp;c. page 6.</note>
                     <hi>nor Light nor Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but in the evening there shall be Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their darknesse and divisions hath been caused by not <hi>knowing Christ in the Spirit, nor understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mystery of Christ,</hi> for all Christian Religions have been doting onely on the flesh of Christ: See the Papists how they look upon Christ in a Picture; so Protestants have their <hi>pleasant Pictures also,</hi>

                     <hi>the Image of a Male,</hi> as the Prophets phrase it, that is, fleshly <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of Christ,</hi> which they adore and deifie: thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> goe no farther than Christ after the flesh, and the last especially, though religious and most learned men, yet look no higher than flesh; yea, the eternall Spirit and infinite God they confine to a place in Heaven, where, say they, his essentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is, though his power be every where, a very carnall conceit of God and of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But what mystery can the <hi>Socinian</hi> see in the Man Christ, if the Man be not God, or <hi>God manifest in flesh?</hi> is not the Man Christ <hi>the Mystery of God? Rev.</hi> 10.7.
<note place="margin">Col. 2.2.

                  <p>For how could the Apostle, preaching to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, prove the Godhead of Christ by Scripture to them, who owned neither Christ nor Scriptures? But <hi>Christ speaking in him,</hi> that is, Christ in the Spirit,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.3.</note> God powerfully acting and appearing in <hi>Pauls</hi> flesh, did so
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118224:21"/>manifest the Mystery to them, that by <hi>the power of God working in him mightily,</hi> he was able to present every man in Christ, that is, <hi>in God,</hi> and God in them, and <hi>they his Off-spring,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.28, 29.</note> and thus did he prove the Godhead of Christ, and that God would judge <hi>the world by the man Christ Jesus,</hi>

                  <p>Indeed to the Jewes, who acknowledged the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by Scriptures he proved that Christ was God, yet not the Godhead of Christ by that, for as Christ never said that he was God (but <hi>sent by God</hi>) so he shewed his Godhead to <hi>be the Father dwelling in him, and doing all his works,</hi> which though neither the Jewes nor Disciples clearly saw in the dayes of his flesh; yet when he should <hi>depart to the Father,</hi> and the Spirit or <hi>Promise of the Father</hi> should be sent, then the power of God appearing in their flesh as in his, he <hi>shewes them the Father plainly,</hi> for as <hi>no man knowes the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne reveales him;</hi> so I said before, that God, even the Father, must reveal the Sonne in us, by the Spirit of Revelation to us, else there is no knowing the Godhead of Christ at all, <hi>John</hi> 14.10. <hi>John</hi> 16.25, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>no man can say that Jesus is the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3.</note>
                     <hi>but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> alas man, what mystery is it that Christ is God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God made the Man so? because God gave him that name? gave him that power and glory as God? 'tis true, that Christ, even the Sonne of God, had all by gift of the Father,
<note place="margin">Iohn 5.19, 22, 26. verses.</note>
                     <hi>The Sonne could doe nothing of himself, God gave him even the Spirit, gave him authority to judge, gave him to have life in himself</hi> (whereas we have all of him,
<note place="margin">Math. 28.18. Iohn 17.2. Phil. 2.6, 9. Heb. 1.8, 9.</note> and by him) <hi>God gave him glory, all power in heaven and earth; God gave him a name above every name,</hi> yea, <hi>gave him to be called God, for God, his God, annointed him to it</hi> above his fellowes; all this proves not the Godhead
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118224:21"/>of Christ, but that he was the <hi>Man Gods fellow, that is, equall with God, in the form if God,</hi> as 'tis parallell'd by the Apostle and Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 9.</p>
                  <p>Therefore what <hi>Socinus</hi> saith, that Christ is God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God gave him that name, that power, that glory, and honour, is no mystery, for God can give <hi>to a Worme, to thresh the mountaines, tothrow down the earth, to destroy and judge the world,</hi> Isai 41.14, 15. Jer. 51.20.</p>
                  <p>But what's the Mystery of Christ? <hi>wait for the Spirit to manifest it</hi> to thee and me: <hi>Till the seventh Angell sound,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 10.7.</note>
                     <hi>the Mystery of God shall not be finished nor fully known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a madnesse is it then, for men to warr and wrangle about that they know not? Is it not better for us, to wait in peace and patience, forbearing one another, and embracing one another in love, till the Lord God appear in all?</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore crave pardon of all men, because I cannot chuse but say, that <hi>no man yet knowes God, nor Christ, nor himself;</hi> this makes the difference and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (as I said before) because men are so confident, and therefore contend of the free Grace of God, the free Will of Man, and the Death of Christ, yet they know not <hi>God as he is,</hi> nor what <hi>Man is in God,</hi> nor what <hi>the Man-God Christ is,</hi> in the Mystery, how in God, and how he is in man: Oh yee <hi>Protestants, Papists, Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> answer me this one question; Why did the highest Apostle beg the prayers of all the Churches, that he might know the <hi>Mystery of Christ,</hi> that he might manifest it, and that he might <hi>speak as he ought to speak?</hi> Eph. 6.19, 20. Col. 4.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>You think you know Christ, and can preach him well enough, we shall be all silent, and God himself shall speak at last, and speak himself, and manifest himself unto men: Oh that men could watch and wait in love together to that day!</p>
                  <p>This is the last thing I had to observe, that all the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118224:22"/>
                     <hi>speaking and preachings of men will be silenced by God</hi> when the Lord appeares: Pray but observe in those four steps before mentioned, of Gods appearance in men, how the power, efficacie, and fruit of Conversion hath decreased: The Doctrine of Free-grace converted fewer than that legall teaching before; the preaching of Christ after the flesh by the purest Churches hath had lesse converts yet; yea, those who preach Christ in the Spirit, the most seraphick Sermons, call in but few Sinners, though some Saints may be raised, others proud flesh rankle thereby; but as for the Spirit of Jesus, where does it appear in mens preaching or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, or the power of godlinesse?</p>
                  <p>That which I conclude from this is, that <hi>God is going out, and departing from all the preachings of men,</hi> that men may give themselves wholly to publick acts of love one to another, and to all mankind; therefore all <hi>religious formes</hi> shall fall, that the <hi>power of righteousnesse</hi> may rise and appear in all:
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.13. Rev. 21.22.</note>
                     <hi>The new Heaven and new Earth, where dwelleth Righteousnesse, hath no form</hi> of Religion there.</p>
                  <p>I see 'tis hastening by many things, and this to me is the least prophetick providence and experience in the present powers of the Nation: when the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> first began, oh what speakings were there? what Speeches of severall Members of the house of Commons were printed every week? but now the Common-wealth comes on, there is more of Action done every day, and though the Parliament many times say more than they doe, yet they doe more than they say, which is best of all.</p>
                  <p>Again, I cannot but observe, that as <hi>the falling of a Sparrow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 10 30.</note>
                     <hi>or the smallest hair of our heads, is subject to the speciall</hi> providence of God; so 'tis remarkable that all the Parliaments Ordinances are now turned into Acts, for Acts indeed are better than Ordinances, these are of form, those of power; the Army was best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when they were about their Ordinances, their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118224:22"/>Guns, going forth for common freedome, those were their Acts, and God did blesse them therein in all their publick actings, and in their publick Spirits, but as for their publick speakings, their Declarations, Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Remonstrances, 'tis not worth a rush: So are their Councels of War, when judging the Consciences of men in the Mystery of Christ (a most high presumption:) yea, all their fasting and prayer before God is not worth a pins head, till they repent and return to their first principles, to the power of Righteousnesse, to Justice, and Mercy to the Nation, without all self-seeking, striving for the universall good of mankind, even for Papists and for Jewes themselves, to live with freedome and comfort among us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. compared with <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>glorious appearance of the great God,</hi> not to talke and prate of things, but to be working and acting, to be ever doing good, as <hi>Christ did alwayes to all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10.38.</note> and though there was a Ministery of men once to speak also glad tydings and good things to men, yet since the Apostacy, that <hi>Apostolick Ministery being silenced,</hi> and the <hi>manifold gifts of the Spirit</hi> ceased, and no man sent of God to <hi>preach the Gospel which the holy Spirit sent down from Heaven,</hi> all is but earth and man that is said,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> the number of the <hi>beast being the number of a man,</hi> Rev. 13.16.</p>
                  <p>And though God hath hitherto <hi>fed and led the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the wildernesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 12.6.</note>
                     <hi>and caused men to minister some truth and peace to his</hi> people under the Apostacy, yet this was but <hi>his Free-grace,</hi> and high <hi>Prerogative of love,</hi> who as not tyed to meanes, so by a false Ministery could convey light and comfort to his own; but now God is pouring vials of wrath on that which was once lovely, upon the Sun and air, upon the light of man, upon the meanes, and those mediums that receive it, Rev. 16.8.17.</p>
                  <p>Again, seeing the man of sinne, the mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118224:23"/>is now more revealed in the Temple of God than ever, and the ministery of men is discovered every day not to be of Gods appointment, as Prelates, and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and purest Independent Pastors, cut off by the Lord himself: it is therefore judged, that not onely the whole Ministry, but all the preachings of men, will shortly be silenced by the glorious appearance of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be silent O all flesh, for the Lord is raised out of his holy habitation, Zach.</hi> 2.13. Why if man be silent, what will God doe among men? <hi>A Father of the fatherlesse, and a Judge of the widow, is God in his holy habitation, Psal.</hi> 68.5. that is, God will so appear in men, that instead of speakings, they shall goe forth in actings of love to mankind, and to the miserable part thereof, to the <hi>poor, to the oppressed, to the fatherlesse, and the widow,</hi> and to all that want that which we abound in.</p>
                  <p>As this was once <hi>pure Religion, and undefiled before God even the Father,</hi>

                  <p>Alas, what is it to send Preachers abroad before the burthens and oppressions of the people be eased?
<note place="margin">Exod. 6.9.</note>
                     <hi>Israel it self could not hear, because of the sore bondage in Aegypt;</hi> I say, not all burthens taken off, because the charge of the Common wealth encreaseth, but why may not rich Citizens, racking Landlords in the Country, and mighty moneyed men, be made immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to rise in their payments, that poor Farmers, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and honest Tradesmen may be spared? Why not oppression be presently eased, at least of Lawyers and Tithes? Why not a Treasury for the poor, when so many thousands a year can be found out to give to the rich? would that hinder the publick more than this?

                  <p>Gifts are as bad as bribes, when Justice and great things are to be done in a Nation, for as a bribe blindes the eyes, and they <hi>shall never see the King in his beauty,</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>glorious appearance of the great God and Saviour in men,</hi> is that which is most <hi>abhorred by Ministers and Pastors, three Shepheards,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>loaths and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides</hi> because they will not be drawn up to union, and love to mankind, to whom they are rather cruell, <hi>their throat an open Sepulchre,</hi> and their feet <hi>swift to shed bloud;</hi> that is, they will speak no <hi>good will to man,</hi> but swallow down the most and destroy them, not owning <hi>all men as their own flesh,</hi>

                  <p>True, it is but <hi>flesh and fleshly formes</hi> the Churches fight and contend for, the cause of all the contention is in the Shepheards or the Ministers, the Church-members, poor soules would be quiet, and come up again to walk in the Spirit; but because the Members will follow, not the Head, but their fellowes, Members and Ministers,

                  <p>How cleer doth this appear in the present Churches, who by a Law call none brothers but such of their own societies, no Saint whatsoever, nor yet Christ were he among them would they call brother, unlesse he were of a Church way, and of theirs also, therefore the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoood between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> (the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and baptized Churches) is broken.</p>

                  <p>The Apostolike Churches or Churches of Christ were but <hi>one bodie,</hi> had but <hi>one Baptism,</hi>

So the valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> hath some reference to the dry bones, and the divided sticks in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whats the valley of <hi>Jehosaphat?</hi> 'Tis the divided state of men opposing the appearance of God in his people. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.23. there is <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> all three of kin to the true Church of God, which those three came against, as the present
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118224:26"/>Churches pretend to the Primitive Church of Christ, which yet they oppose in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Well, let us look into the <hi>valley of Jehosaphat,</hi> thither <hi>cause thy mighty ones to come down O Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Joel</hi> 3.11. Oh how many mighty ones, and high spirited men are come down <hi>to the valley of Jehosaphat, into divided Churches, Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>mount Seir:</hi> First, two are against one, then one against another, for <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> stood up against <hi>mount Seir utterly to slay and destroy, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of mount Seir, each man helped to destroy one another,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.23.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was with the <hi>Prelatick, Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Churches, these two last <hi>stood up, utterly to slay and destroy</hi> the first both Root and Branch, and now they <hi>help to destroy one another,</hi> as Independent and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Churches both against Presbytery, and now <hi>these two against each other:</hi> Yea, the baptized Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are divided into three parts, are now in destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by <hi>their own divisions:</hi> Sure it is by the <hi>annointing</hi> all this is done, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord in their flesh, which would unite doth now divide them, because they will not hear <hi>what the Spirit saith to the Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it is said before 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.22. <hi>The Lord set ambushments against the children of</hi> Moab, Ammon, <hi>and mount Seir,</hi> &amp;c. an ambushment in <hi>secret and sudden assault of an enemie</hi> unawares: Oh how <hi>secretly and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi> hath the Lord come upon the Churches in their <hi>march</hi> and <hi>Church-way?</hi> how hath he <hi>divided them one against another,</hi> before they were aware of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>As this is <hi>Babylons</hi> judgement to fall by division, so it is the judgement of God on the Churches, for in the <hi>valley of Jehoshaphat he sits to judge.</hi>

                  <p>Independency is down in a <hi>moneth,</hi> thats a shorter time then the former, they are fallen before they rise, the whole Armie cannot help them up again.</p>
                  <p>But what is this moneth? It is that of the <hi>wild Asse in the Wild rness,</hi> the Lord compares the Church to this, <hi>Jer,</hi> 2.24. <hi>A wild Asse used to the Wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure, in her occasion who can turn her away, all they that seek her will not weary themselves, in her moneth they shall find her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the <hi>moneth</hi> that we may find <hi>the Asse,</hi> for men weary themselves in vain to seek her, she is <hi>so wild,</hi> and in the <hi>wilderness</hi> also, where she <hi>holds up her head,</hi> and <hi>snuffs the wind</hi> as she goes, neither will <hi>she be turned out of her way,</hi> yet in <hi>her moneth she is found;</hi> Whats that! It is the <hi>moneth that she is ready to bear or bring forth,</hi> when she is full of pain and travell, when the <hi>wild Asse</hi> is in a <hi>suffering condition</hi> she may be found.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was with the Churches; The Prelates thought themselves Preachers of the Gospel, how high did they hold their heads, <hi>and snuffe the wind as they went,</hi> but when their suffering time came, the <hi>spirits of Princes</hi> were cut off, the proudest Prelate dared not open his mouth for his eares, that shewed him an Asse, for if he had been as he said a Preacher of the Gospel, all the Parliaments of the world should not have stopt his mouth, but they had no more to say when they came to suffer, then without seeking a man might find them to be no Ministers of the Gospel, <hi>for their moneth was</hi> come.</p>
                  <p>It was just so with the Presbyters, when in power with the Parliament, they-also were as <hi>wild as the Asse</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as proud as the Prelates, and held up their heads as high, and opened their mouths (against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) as Ministers of the Gospel also, but when <hi>the moneth</hi> of their sorrows and sufferings come to an end, they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118224:27"/>will be dumb <hi>as the Asse,</hi> and as Bishops were, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less God by a Miracle open their mouth, as <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse to speak freely, the next countermand that comes from the Powers can silence them, or if they suffer the losse of Tithes, all their mouthes are stopt at once, for <hi>their moneth</hi> is come, they are cut off by God, and can preach no more.</p>
                  <p>Well, the Independent Pastors and Teachers their moneth comes (and that in one day as <hi>Babylons</hi> plague did) I will not compare these wise men to the Asse in the Wilderness, yet truly they will not be turned from their way,
<note place="margin">Hos. 12.1.</note> but snuffe the wind as they goe (<hi>for it is wind that</hi> Ephraim <hi>feeds on</hi>) Oh, when will their moneth be? Whence can their sufferings arise, seeing the whole State, and the highest Souldierie is for them? For all this they must suffer, all the world cannot save them, but what shall their sufferings be? Surely <hi>not from man, nor by man, but by the Lord God they shall suffer,</hi> as it is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold, <hi>Isai.</hi> 31.8, 9. <hi>The Assyrian is the last Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> for <hi>Egypt</hi> was before. The Churches this day doe <hi>oppresse not onely men in their States, Mic.</hi> 2.2, 8, 9. but the <hi>spirits of men,</hi> vers. 6. Yea, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> also, vers. 7.</p>
                  <p>The present Churches I look upon as the <hi>Assyrian</hi> the last oppressor that shall be in the Land, this is the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that shall fall?</hi> How! not <hi>by man, and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him, Isai.</hi> 31.8. How shall the Assyrians fall be then? First, by fear. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by fire. <hi>The sinners of Zion are afraid already, and begin to fly to their strong holds,</hi> and hope in an Armie or arm of flesh, <hi>v.</hi> 8. What makes them <hi>fear and fly?</hi> Oh there is an <hi>Ensign set up in the Saints,</hi> v. 9. the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God in the <hi>scattered Saints</hi> makes the <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Churches</hi> quake and fear; but where is the <hi>fire?</hi> Why it is in Zion, <hi>and his furnace in Jerusalem,</hi> v. 9. What is <hi>Zion but the Saints in whom God dwels,</hi> or in whom God discovers himself to be. Is he not in the Churches
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118224:28"/>also? Yea, the Lord is there among them, the <hi>everlasting burnings is in them,</hi> yea, they shall finde and feel short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>consuming fire</hi> to break forth upon them, and to <hi>burn up all their flesh and forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the judgement of God still on the Churches, because they would hasten to a Church-way, not waiting for the <hi>Baptism of the Spirit, and of fire</hi> to set them in a Gospel-order, or to shew <hi>them a higher glory to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them;</hi> therefore a fire shall come forth of their own bowels to burn them, that is the fire of his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: Thus they are gone from one fire into another, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tels them, <hi>They shall go out from one fire and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fire shall devour them,</hi> Ezek. 15.7. they are gone out of the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>fire of his jealousie</hi> shall consume them, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.3. I speak not now of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons but of that oppressive principle and fleshly power, thats the Assyrian in them, as I said once, that of old the people of God <hi>were in Babylon,</hi> but now <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>in them,</hi> especially in the Churches called the <hi>oppressor, the golden Citie,</hi> Isai. 14.4.</p>
                  <p>But see how the fire is come in to the Churches as we said before,
<note place="margin">Zach. 11.</note> there not onely the Cedars, the tallest and highest members are burnt, <hi>v.</hi> 2. but all the mighty men (or gallants) are spoiled, even the Ministers or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, for the howling of the Shepherds is heard on high, <hi>v.</hi> 3. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Pray observe in all the Prophets what plagues are foretold to fall upon the <hi>Pastors and Shepherds of Israel;</hi> but especially <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Ch. 25.34, 35, 36. where there is a great <hi>howling of the Shepherds and principall of the flock, for the day of their dispersion is come,</hi> or their division as we said before, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.6, 9. Here they doe <hi>eat every one the flesh of another,</hi> of his fellow or brother, as the Hebrew reads; thus the fellow-members fall out, and the <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood is broken</hi> between the Churches, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Why? because their Shepherds are <hi>cut off</hi> in one <hi>moneth;</hi> whats that? we have said already 'tis the <hi>day of their sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118224:28"/>
                  <p> But there may be another sense of this <hi>moneth,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Prophet, <hi>Hosea</hi> 5.6, 7. <hi>They shall gee with their flocks to seek the Lord, but they shall not find him, he hath withdrawn himself from them; they have dealt treacherously against the Lord, for they have begotten strange children, now shall a moneth devour them with their portions;</hi> There are strange men and women Church-members this day, strange children indeed; Ile say no more of them, the wicked sing, a wonderfull <hi>and horrible thing is committed in the Land,</hi> that is, in the Church: what is that? read <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.26, to 30.</p>
                  <p>But what is the moneth here? Is it not some change think you, as the Moon doth every moneth? Sure <hi>the next change or turne of things will overturn all the Churches,</hi> for a <hi>third overturn will be:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 21.27.</note> The first was of <hi>Kingly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> by the Parliament, then the <hi>Prelates</hi> fell; the second was of <hi>Parliamentary Priviledges,</hi> when the Army came up to purge it, then <hi>Presbyters</hi> fell: there will be a <hi>third overturn,</hi> whether for better or worse I know not, yet I hope well of the Common-wealth, and Rulers thereof, but down goe the ruling Elders with all their Churches, the very next moneth, when a change of things will be.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, May not <hi>this moneth</hi> be another thing, yet something more?
<note place="margin">Psal. 119.96.</note> (for the <hi>Commands of God are exceeding broad,</hi> and there is a mighty bredth, height, and length in the least word of his) what is the <hi>moneth?</hi> Is it not the <hi>new Moon</hi> spoken of so much by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as a type of that <hi>new Moon and Sabbath</hi> which shall be in the <hi>new Jerusalem,</hi> Isai. 66.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>What is the <hi>new Moon</hi> then? Truly to me it is <hi>new Light,</hi> as <hi>our life in God alone is the Sabbath</hi> there spoken: oh how terrible is this to the Pastors and Teachers to look for <hi>new light,</hi> much more to look on it, it will dazle and destroy their sight, and make them stark blind, and also dumb, as we shall see anon.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>moneth</hi> we know the <hi>Moon</hi> receives <hi>new light</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118224:29"/>as we call it, then the <hi>new Moon,</hi> though it be the old still; so the <hi>new light</hi> is nothing but the old, even the <hi>everlasting Gospel,</hi> that <hi>glory hid in God before the world,</hi> will come <hi>forth in men</hi> at last; yea, that <hi>old light of Law and Gospel-Churches,</hi> which hath been <hi>hid</hi> and darkened by the Apostacy, shall be more fully known, and come forth from all that traditionall knowledge of God which is yet received by men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.23.</p>
                  <p>Oh this <hi>moneth</hi> will be a <hi>day of doom</hi> to the Churches, the <hi>new Moon,</hi> this <hi>new light,</hi> will darken them at <hi>noon day;</hi> pray read <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. where there is a greater than this yeares Eclipse, the earth is not onely darkened at noon, but <hi>the Sun goes down, and sets at high noon:</hi> What is that? When men think they are in <hi>highest light,</hi> as Churches look no higher, God doth suddenly <hi>darken them,</hi> and makes them also <hi>dumb,</hi> verse 11. for there is none left to preach the Word, being no more to be heard from North to East, verse 12. from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why is all this wrath think yee? <hi>The end is come upon my people Israel,</hi> that is the Church, verse 2. then there is the <hi>howling of the Shepheards,</hi> and their <hi>filencing,</hi> verse 3.</p>
                  <p>This is wrath indeed, but what is the cause of all? Sure first because the Churches <hi>take no care for the poor of the Land,</hi> verse 4. they may look to their own poor, but the poor of the Land <hi>are swallowed up</hi> by their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and made to fail, for the Ministers will not open their mouths, nor speak a good word for them to the present Governours, who doubtlesse would and will help the poor at last, though never moved by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, They cannot abide <hi>new light,</hi> therefore darknesse comes as we said, <hi>when will the new Moon be gone,</hi> say they, or as the margin reads, the <hi>new Moneth?</hi> this kills the Pastors and Teachers, this <hi>one Moneth</hi> cuts them-off by God.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:118224:29"/>
                  <p> But why would they have <hi>this new Moon gone, and the Sabbath past?</hi> Oh that they may <hi>sell Corn, and set forth Wheat,</hi> verse 5. for there is no buying nor selling, nor a stitch of work to be done on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wheat, what is that? <hi>What is the Chaffe to the Wheat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 23.28.</note> saith the Prophet? Wheat sure is the <hi>pure Word,</hi> called the <hi>fat of the Kidneyes of Wheat,</hi> and so the <hi>pure word</hi> is,
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.14.</note> it is the finest fattening thing that man can take, that <hi>immortall seed of the Word, when it is sincere, spirituall, and pure,</hi> how pretious, and how powerfull it is?

                  <p>But suppose <hi>it be Wheat that they sell?</hi> it is but the <hi>refuse of Wheat, as themselves confessse, Amos</hi> 8.6. what lean, low, and legall teachings doe our Preachers of the Gospel set forth and sell? it is but <hi>the refuse of all,</hi> that which good Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Preston,</hi> and the rest of those pious men left behind; it is not <hi>their spirit</hi> these men speak with, it is but their words, or the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of old Writers in a new dresse.</p>
                  <p>Nay most of these Pastors or Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel can goe no farther than the <hi>flesh of Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A chief one of the Army would once usually say, that the <hi>flesh of Christ,</hi> and <hi>letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> were the two great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.

                  <p>I doe not blame the Governours of our State, for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such honour and preferment on the heads of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers, <hi>Constantine</hi> did more, yet more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief followed, and the <hi>Church as they say, fell asleep in</hi> Constantines <hi>lap,</hi> so I wish the wise and godly Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Common-wealth to consider:</p>
                  <p>I pray consider, is it according <hi>to the order of the Gospel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> that Pastors should leave their own <hi>Church-fellowships,</hi> and turn <hi>fellows of Colledges?</hi> Is it according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel that Pastors should become Princes and Presidents, Deans and Doctors?

                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the great hand of God, and worthy of the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all those (Ministers) who taking into their hands the Instruments of a foolish Shepherd, to wit, medling with worldly policies, and mixtures of earthly power, to set up that which they call the Kingdome of Christ, which is neither it, nor if it were, would such meanes be found effectunll for that end, and neglect or not trust to the word of God, the sword of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>That this is not a spiritual but a <hi>secular</hi> power, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118224:31"/>
                     <hi>earthly mixture</hi> appears because an Universitie is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the School of Nature elevated and improved by Art, not by Religious forms (though the power of it be precious) but by excellencie of learning which Pastors and Teachers are not much acquainted with, so were fitter men.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.32.</note> but it is the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note on <hi>Acts</hi> 6.12. That the first bloudie <hi>Persecution of the Church of Christ sprang up and began from a company of Priests by the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of Ʋniversitie Doctors.</hi>

                     <hi>They sell the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shooes.</hi> That is, if there be a righteous poor man that seeks the publike good <hi>of the Common-wealth,</hi> or the <hi>good of mankind,</hi> they will either keep him poor, or make him rich, they will stop his mouth with a <hi>piece of silver,</hi> or send him away in a <hi>pair of shooes.</hi> Whats that? set him in a <hi>good office,</hi> or <hi>gainfull imployment,</hi> thats <hi>a pair of shooes</hi> that many an honest heart is bought and sold for.</p>
                  <p>I wonder that the Prophet should say of God, <hi>Thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,</hi>

                  <p>Truly it were well the tidings had bin true, That we Christians would have no more silver and gold from the <hi>Indies,</hi> then gold should not be our God: But now I fear me that <hi>Mammon</hi> is not onely the <hi>god</hi> of the world, but the god of Churches also, yea many good Christians make Mammon and money their God.</p>

                  <p>Indeed if any man doth but observe and follow the foot-steps of the Almighty this day, in his wayes and wonders among men, his glorious Appearance, and his Power, and Goodnesse in this Land hath been most visible to, and by the Magistrate Civill and Martiall, at home and abroad, both by land and sea, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Alas, what have the Ministers done, but undone themselves and others? and still like to undoe the whole Nation, as the Prelates in the first warre, the Presbyters in the second warre, and though a third warre will not be, yet the prosperity, peace, and happy proceedings
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118224:34"/>of the present Powers, how had the Independent and Baptized Churches like to hinder? how saucy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent were they about a new Representative? yea, no Parliament men, but Church-members, or chosen by them, was once in print: it is more observable, those Churches who could never communicate, nor come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before, became as one Congregation, to divide and undoe the Common-wealth if possibly they could.</p>
                  <p>Well said noble Generall again. <hi>We pray you own his people more and more, for they are the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel, disown your selves, but own your authority and power to curb the proud and the insolent, such as would disturb the tranquility of</hi> England, <hi>under what specious pretences soever; releive the oppressed, hear the groanes of the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in</hi> England (when Lord God holy and true, and a Treasury for the poor?) <hi>Be pleased to reform the abuses of all Professions, and if there be any one that makes many poor to make a few rich, that suits not a Common-wealth:</hi>

                  <p>How many <hi>men are made poor,</hi> by making a few <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters rich?</hi> therefore there is but little good done by the <hi>greatest Ministers</hi> this day in <hi>England and Ireland;</hi> their whole work is in calling men to <hi>Church, not to Christ,</hi> in converting <hi>Saints, not Sinners:</hi> alas man, it is not the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but thine own <hi>gain</hi> thou most lookest after.</p>
                  <p>That which you hear of so many <hi>called in Wales,</hi> is not so true as the report, it is but <hi>to Church</hi> that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes run, and most to <hi>the waters,</hi> but alas poor soules, they are still as simple and earthly as ever they were, as ignorant, carnall, and covetous, as little power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, or knowledge in the Mystery of Christ, self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, sincerity, and singlenesse of heart: oh they are more double and divided, that light and love which was formerly in <hi>Wales</hi> in good Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi>'s dayes, is dead with him, and quite darkened.</p>

                  <p>Truly in all that I have said,

                  <p>Lastly, Let no <hi>Independent Pastor, nor Presbyters,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing themselves <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> dare to meddle any more with <hi>Tithes,</hi> forced <hi>Contributions,</hi> or <hi>Consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
